# HostException in CmdLine task

CmdLine task contains two types of exception handlers Node10 and PowerShell (only on Windows). When running task on windows that have installed PowerShell task will be executed through PowerShell handler. There are some conditions when PowerShell could throw HostException while task execution. While this exception doesn't affect customer script execution it will fail the pipeline run itself. This HostException is generated by [SetConsoleWindowTitle](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7dc4587014bfa22919c933607bf564f0ba53db2e/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleControl.cs#L2514) in PowerShell internals, which should be ignored for non-interactive cases. This bug should be fixed on the PowerShell side.

CmdLine task has an option to mitigate the issue, you can set `ignoreHostException` input the `true` to not fail the task in case this type of exception occurred.
